We maintain a canonical list of industries which you may select to define your business. We used to have a long list, but everyone asked us to keep it simple and pare it down. Lesson learned! 

Why select your industry from the list? We keep simple demographic data about our customers, and it's very helpful to know where our biggest concentrations of customers are so we can prioritize their needs.


Get industries
------------

* `GET /industries.json` will return our canonical list of industries. There is no pagination because we curate the list and keep in short.

```json
